    Description: find minimum number of operations to convert word1 to word2 (3 operations allowed: insert, delete or replace a character)
    
    Time Complexity: O(m*n)
    Space Complexity: O(n)
    where m is length of target (word2) and n is length of source (word1)
    
    Approach: Use of dp array
    - start a dp array to identify number of operations matching "-" to each proceeding character of the source string
    - in next iteration (starting first character of target)
      + the first element of the dp array should be the index of the character
      + otherwise, the number of operations are 1 + minimum operations applied to current index (for source) and preceeding index (target)
      + last element of the dp array can be returned as result
