## Problem148 Edit Distance (https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/)
Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character

Delete a character

Replace a character

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"

Output: 3

Explanation: 

horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')

rorse -> rose (remove 'r')

rose -> ros (remove 'e')

Example 2:

Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"

Output: 5

Explanation: 

intention -> inention (remove 't')

inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')

enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')

exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')

exection -> execution (insert 'u')

## Problem149 Regular Expression Matching (https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/)

Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.

'.' Matches any single character.

'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

Note:

s could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z.

p could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z, and characters like . or *.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "aa"

p = "a"

Output: false

Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".

Example 2:

Input:

s = "aa"

p = "a*"

Output: true

Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".

Example 3:

Input:

s = "ab"

p = ".*"

Output: true

Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".

Example 4:

Input:

s = "aab"

p = "c*a*b"

Output: true

Explanation: c can be repeated 0 times, a can be repeated 1 time. Therefore, it matches "aab".

Example 5:

Input:

s = "mississippi"

p = "mis*is*p*."

Output: false
