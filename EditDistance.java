/**
 * Intuition: Each character in the word1 can be added, deleted or updated and after that the resultant string again has the same options.
 *             using dp, each char is again given 3 options, one from the top, other from the left and the last from beside(left). Using these a decision has to be made based on whether the character is matching or not at that position
 *
 *             Ex: word1 : horse word2: ros  task is to convert word1 to word2 and return min actions required to do so.
 *             - h o r s e
 *           - 0 1 2 3 4 5  // here from col - want to change it to row - : require 0 moves, from col -h to - require 1 and -ho to - require 2 and so on
 *           r 1 1 2 2 3 4  // here from col - want to change it to row -r : require 1 move, from col -h to row -r require 1, from -ho to -r require 2 moves n so on
 *           o 2 2 1 2 3 4
 *           s 3 3 2 2 2 3
 *  Time: O(m*n) m and n - are the lengths of word1 and word2 respectively
 *  Space: O(m*n)
